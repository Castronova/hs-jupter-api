    "You have been redirected to this page because you wish to explore, modify, and/or interact with your HydroShare resources using Python.  This notebook has been launched inside your very own userspace so that your edits can be saved for later use.  The notebook server is arranged in the following manner:\n",

    "- Notebooks: (`the main directory space`)\n",
    "  - Examples: (`a directory space for HydroShare related examples`)\n",
    "  - Documents: (`a directory for you to create and save custom notebooks`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "The **examples** directory will be periodically updated to provide HydroShare users new notebook examples, which unfortunately means that anything saved here may be overwritten or lost. For this reason, we recommend that you use the **Documents** directory for you personal notebooks instead of the examples directory. \n",

    "### Terminal Commands\n",
    "Any terminal commands that you have access to, can executed by prepending the command with and exclamation point (`!`).  For example, issue the following command to list the path to the current working directory `!pwd`.\n",

    "### HydroShare Commands\n",
    "You can interact with HydroShare resources using REST web service calls.  To help you issue these REST commands, the `hs_restclient` library ([readthedocs](http://hs-restclient.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is installed on the system and is available for you to use.  In addition, a utility library has been provided to you, `hs_utilities`, which bundles some of useful commands into easy-to-use functions.\n",
