    "You've arrived at the HydroShare Python Notebook Server. This environment provides web-based programming and model execution functionality for HydroShare users. It has been configured with many scientific libraries, tools, and models to enable easy manipulation of HydroShare data using the Python programming language.  You can also save notebooks back into HydroShare or launch existing notebooks from HydroShare into this environment.  This provides a unique solution to sharing preliminary and published research with collaborators and colleagues.\n",

A **Jupyter notebook** is an enhanced computational environment that combines rich text and code execution into a single script-like container. The HydroShare Python Notebook Server aims to combine this standard notebook functionality with the HydroShare data hosting platform to provide a rich computational environment for water scientists.\n",
